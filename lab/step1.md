### Step 1 - Setting the environment

To get started, we are going to clone this repo, which contains the structure of the solution that we are going to use.

In your computer's terminal:

```bash
git clone https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/sfloresk/CLUS18-DEVNET-2897.git $HOME/CLUS18-DEVNET-2897
```

Then, create a virtual environment and install requirements

```bash
cd $HOME/CLUS18-DEVNET-2897
virtualenv devnet2897
source devnet2897/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
